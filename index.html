    <h1>ZeroClick Testing Site</h1>
    <p>Here is where you can test the current version of ZeroClick to see if it works! Try to use the following commands.
        If the command doesn't work, then great! If it does, then that's an issue. Please open up a new issue on the
        official <a href="https://github.com/WebTelegraph/ZeroClick/issues/new">ZeroClick GitHub repo</a>.</p>

    <h2>Commands to try</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>F12 (typically opens the developer tools.)</li>
            <li>CTRL+SHIFT+I (typically opens the developer tools.)</li>
            <li>CTRL+SHIFT+C (typically opens the developer tools.)</li>
            <li>CTRL+SHIFT+J (typically opens the developer tools.)</li>
            <li>CTRL+U (typically opens the "view-source" page.)</li>
        </ol>
        If any of these commands result in the developer tools or "view-source" pages being opened, then please be sure to
        <a href="https://github.com/WebTelegraph/ZeroClick/issues/new">report it</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Using this site for development</h2>
    If you create a version of ZeroClick with updated or added code, then update this template site with more commands for
    users to try, and any extra notes you may have. This isn't required right now, but it would make things easier. In the
    future, we may require this.
